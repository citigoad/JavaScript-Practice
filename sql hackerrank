sql functions I have learnt in Hackerrank

mod(id,2) - to find modulus and select accordingly.

len() to find the length of the string.

union - uniting two quiries - suppose if u want first and last record in one select query.

like for quering substings,  to search multiple strings u should put like this///
select city from station where city like 'a%' or city like 'e%' or city like 'i%' or city like 'o%' or city like 'u%';
select city from station where city regexp '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';
select distinct city from station where city not regexp '[aeiou]$';

regexp - ^ starting
       - $ ending
