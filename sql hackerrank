sql functions I have learnt in Hackerrank

mod(id,2) - to find modulus and select accordingly.

len() to find the length of the string.

union - uniting two quiries - suppose if u want first and last record in one select query.

like for quering substings,  to search multiple strings u should put like this///
select city from station where city like 'a%' or city like 'e%' or city like 'i%' or city like 'o%' or city like 'u%';
select city from station where city regexp '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';
select distinct city from station where city not regexp '[aeiou]$';

regexp - ^ starting
       - $ ending


select round(Avg(population)) from city - round is a function which rounds to the nearest interger.

case statement----------------
SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES;
